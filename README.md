Reinforcement Learning from (not with) Scratch! 
This project consists of two main parts: a custom built Eigen-based Neural Network library that's tailored to simple Reinforcement Learning problems, and a framework to make environments and train agents. 
The motivation for this project was trying to use OpenAI's Gym and seeing how painfully slow it was. When you get rid a lot of the bells and whistles (and code in C++) you can train agents much faster!

Hopefully more documentation to come soon, but for now, check out these demonstration videos showcasing [agents playing Multiball Pong](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ed6eK1ncQJYuCt0P5Yj5mEkwzNI7S8bj/view?usp=drive_link) and a [comparison of RL agents gameplayed compared to GA agents](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yv2bmz6GFYy7exfW86DdrDux9ipdIGLA/view?usp=drive_link)! I found it fascinating how qualitatively different the neuron activations were between the agents trained via RL and those trained with my genetic algorithm project.
